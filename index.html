<h2> Electronics and Communication Engineering </h2>
<p>Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE) involves researching, designing, developing, and testing electronic equipment used in various systems. Electronics and Communications engineers also conceptualize and oversee the manufacturing of communications and broadcast systems. This stream of engineering deals with analog transmission, basic electronics, microprocessors, solid-state devices, digital and analog communication, analog integrated circuits, microwave engineering, satellite communication, antennae, and wave progression. It also deals with the manufacturing of <em>electronic devices, circuits, and communications equipment</em>. In India, Electronics and Communications Engineering is offered by various colleges at the UG as well PG level leading to<abbr title="Bachelor of technology"> </abbr>BTech (4 years) and MTech (2 years) degrees respectively.</p>

<h2> Civil Engineering</h2>
<p>One of the oldest and broadest engineering disciplines, Civil Engineering involves planning, designing, constructing, maintaining and supervising infrastructures which include facilities essential to modern life like highways, bridges and tunnels, schools, hospitals, airports and other buildings, sewage systems and water treatment facilities. Subsequently, the course also involves protecting the public and environmental health as well as improving existing infrastructure. According to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc, the Civil Engineering Market size is expected to grow up to USD 11.72 trillion by 2025. Various colleges in India offer Civil engineering at the UG and PG level, thus leading to BTech and MTech degrees respectively.</p>
